            <h2 class="secheading">Adventure Time</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme
                sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained by such activities <br> <br>Adventure in many ways has been proven
                beneficial for us. Surmounting a challenge during an adventure is a brilliant way to leave us feeling positive about ourselves & thus has a positive impact on our mental health. Adventure & exploration can also really help us expand our
                horizons about nature, culture & more. Sometimes, it can also help us have a deeper insight about ourselves. This happens when we let ourselves loose in an unfamiliar situation. It can let our hidden strengths unveil and make us push our
                limits

            </div>
            <p class="text">Adventure cycling is a low-cost way to cycle long distances, explore different areas, and often camp overnight. Adventure cycling trips can range from a few days to several months and can take place on paved roads, gravel roads, or off-road
                trails <br> <br>Adventure cycling tours can be self-contained, van-supported, fully supported, or inn-to-inn. They can range in difficulty from family-friendly rides to expert-level tours through the high mountains <br><br> Bicycle touring
                is another type of cycling trip that can range from single-day trips to extended travels spanning weeks or months. Bicycle touring is self-contained and is taken for pleasure, adventure, or autonomy rather than sport, commuting, or exercise.</p>

                <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes. Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it
                does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the worl. <br> <br> Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres,
                though flights of one to five hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable
                for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools. <br> <br>The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using
                a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures
                often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.</p>
